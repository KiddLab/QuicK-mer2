A tutorial for running the QuicK-mer2 Human Rarity Extension

-A sample file has been provided: DM09_subset.qm2.bed in the qm2_human_rarity folder

	-This is a human patient sample that has already been processed by QuicK-mer2, and copy number has been identified in relation to GrCH38

	- This sample has been trimmed down from the normal size for ease of processing - it includes only the first two chromosomes plus the beginning of chr3

Follow the tutorial_notebook.ipynb for additional details for processing DM09_subset!

1. Add the following import: from qm2_human_rarity import compare_against_1000

2. Read in the file using compare_against_1000.read_in_qm2
	- This needs two arguments: the filename, and a boolean for whether or not this is a full GrCH38 file (for this subset, this is False)
	- This produces two outputs: a numpy table of one row and X columns, where X = the number of windows in your file, and each entry is the copy number at that state; the second output is a dictionary where key = column index and value = the actual human coordinate

3. Calculate duplications: compare_against_1000.find_dups(output_table, output_dict)
	- The arguments are the numpy table and dictionary produced by step 2
	- The result is a list of lists of pairs, where each pair is [Copy number, window index], each inner list is a single duplication containing all the windows fulfilling the condition (cn > 2.5), and the final list is a compilation of all duplications found in the sample.

4. Calculate deletions: compare_against_1000.find_deletions(output_table, output_dict)
	- The arguments are the numpy table and dictionary produced by step 2
	- The result is a list of lists of pairs, where each pair is [Copy number, window index], each inner list is a single deletion containing all the windows fulfilling the condition (cn < 1.5), and the final list is a compilation of all deletions found in the sample.

5. Output duplications and deletions as a file using compare_against_1000.write_dups_and_dels(output_dict, dups, deletions, sample_name)
	- The output_dict is the same one from Step 2
	- Dups are produced by Step 3; this is optional, can do just deletions
	- Deletions are produced by Step 4; this is optional, can do just duplications
	- sample_name is an optional name, defaults to "sample"; can pass "DM09_subset" as the sample name
	- This function will write two files, sample_name_duplications.bed and sample_name_deletions.bed 

6. Comparing duplications and deletions using compare_against_1000.find_rarity
